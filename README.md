# TCP-System
Working TCP socket server & client system for C# in Unity.
Place the server core script onto a game object in your scene in play mode, then place the client as well. After 3 seconds you should see in console that packet 1 was sent successfully.

This can be expanded upon to create a login system, as well as send any number of different packets back and forth to create any type of game, with the exception of very fast paced realtime games that would be better suited with UDP.
